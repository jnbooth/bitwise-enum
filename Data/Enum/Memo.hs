-- | Immutable lazy tables of functions over bounded enumerations.
-- Function calls are stored as thunks and not evaluated until accessed.
--
-- In order to be used as a key, an enumeration type should start at 0 and be
-- total over its range. In other words:
--
-- > [0 .. fromEnum maxBound] == map fromEnum [minBound .. maxBound]
--
-- __This property is not automatically checked.__ The 'appropriate' function
-- does so as a debugging tool, but elsewhere it is assumed to be true.
-- Derived instances of @Bounded@ and @Enum@ always obey this condition.
--
-- The underlying representation is a 'Vector' rather than a search tree.
-- This provides O(1) lookup but means that the range of keys should not be
-- very large, as in the case of an @Int@-like type.
